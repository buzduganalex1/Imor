            <h2>Abstract</h2>

            <p><strong>Imor (Image Smart Processor)</strong> is an extensible microservice-based system able to perform
                processing tasks such as browsing, smart faceted searching & filtering, etc. Adopting Deep Learning and
                Machine Learning techniques, and Semantic Web technologies, the platform is able to generate various
                visualizations (e.g., semantic zoom), correlations, classifications, and recommendations exposed via a
                SPARQL Endpoint.

            <section id="serverless-side">

                <h3>Serverless Side</h3>

                <aside typeof="schema:WPSideBar">
                    <center>The two main paradigms used in the design of <strong>Imor</strong> are Serverless and
                        Microservices.</center>
                </aside>

                <p>
                    <strong>Serverless</strong> states that the functionalities of the application should not depend
                    on any server entity and they should run unknowingly 'anywhere' (e.g. cloud). The Node module
                    'serverless' toolkit helps us describe and deploy the mechanisms of our application in the Azure
                    Functions, the cloud service used to 'host' the main workhorses.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Microservices</strong> architectural style represents a distinctive method of conceiving
                    software systems. Each functionality or service is independent, deployable, small and modular,
                    meaning that each one is as decoupled as possible from another. Combining this concept with the
                    'serverless' concept, each microservice in our application runs in a separate Azure Function,
                    unified by a central API Management. This one respects the REST API concepts and it will expose
                    different paths for each microservice.

                    <ul>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>An OpenAPI specification</strong> has been developed that describes the API paths and
                    behaviour as you can see here:
                    <a href="file:///C:/GitRepos/Imor/ProjectFiles/src/controllers/doc/index.html">Imor Swaggerhub -
                        OpenAPI</a>.
                    Each microservice interrogates RDF datasources - WikiData and DBPedia and stores them into
                    Imor's RDF storage implemented with NeoJs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Authentication</strong> component relies on the JSON Web Token technology that is used
                    by an 'authorizer' represented by an Azure function. Each call of the REST API exposed by
                    Imor requires the auth token and the access is forbidden if it is invalid or missing.

            <section id="client-side">
                <h3>Client-side</h3>

                <p>
                    The <strong>User Interface</strong> of the application will be created with the help of Angular as
                    the foundation client-side framework and Cordova as the main development
                    environment which supports mobile devices and plugins for a whole suite of services and features.

                            Being a 'microservices-serverless-oriented' application, each functionality will dwell into
                            a Azure Function. Each of it will interrogate different datasources upon the search request
                            of
                            an entity. After the result will be returned successfully, the entity instance will be
                            saved in the Imor's RDF storage and interlinked with other entities.

                            The user must register and generate a JWT before using the REST API exposed by Imor. Every
                            subsequent call of the API will require the token.

                            The 'preferred' data transfer MIME type of Imor is <code>application/json</code> for the

                            Each instance's view for an entity type will smartly suggest

                <p>
                    Imor has been created to ease up the search of images by providing an
                    intuitive platform that uses semantic Web concepts to enhance the
                    way of visualizing the relationships between various entities. The
                    application can be extended and improved in different ways by conceiving new mechanisms and
                    architectural ideas.
