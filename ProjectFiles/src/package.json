  "description": "Considering the Kaggle Image Datasets, develop an extensible microservice-based system able to perform processing tasks such as browsing, smart faceted searching & filtering, etc. Adopting both deep learning (or machine learning) techniques and semantic Web technologies, the platform will be able to generate various visualizations (e.g., semantic zoom), correlations, classifications, and recommendations exposed via a SPARQL endpoint. Also, a comparison study will be provided to explain the obtained results.",
