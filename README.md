## Vips

By using the YouTube-8M labeled video dataset, create an extensible microservice-based platform able to perform processing tasks such as browsing, smart faceted searching & filtering, etc. Adopting both machine learning (or deep learning) techniques and semantic Web technologies, the system will be able to make various visualizations (e.g., semantic zoom), correlations, classifications, and recommendations exposed via a SPARQL endpoint. Also, a comparison study will be provided to explain the obtained results.

We have a documentation on https://vips.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
